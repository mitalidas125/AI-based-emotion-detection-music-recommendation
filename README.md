🎵 AI-Based Emotion Detection from Typing Behaviour & Music Recommendation System

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect a user’s emotional state based on their typing behaviour patterns. The system analyzes features like:

Typing speed

Total typing time

Characters per second

Word count

Gap between key presses

Using these features, the model classifies the user’s emotion into one of the following categories:

Happy

Sad

Angry

Calm

Once the emotion is detected, the system automatically provides a music recommendation that matches the mood.
